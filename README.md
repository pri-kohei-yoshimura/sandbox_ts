## Simple TODO List

This repository includes a small TypeScript program that implements a very
basic TODO list.  It can be used from the command line or in the browser.

### CLI usage

```bash
# compile TypeScript sources
npm run build

# run the CLI
npm start
```

### Browser usage

```bash
# build the project and start a simple web server
npm run serve

# then open http://localhost:8080/public/index.html in your browser
```

### Running tests

```bash
npm test
```

Tasks are kept in memory only for both versions.
