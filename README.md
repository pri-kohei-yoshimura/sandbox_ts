## Simple TODO List

This repository includes a small TypeScript program that implements a very
basic command line TODO list. To try it out:

```bash
# compile TypeScript sources
npx tsc

# run the CLI
node dist/cli.js
```

The program allows you to add tasks, list them and remove tasks during a single
session. Tasks are kept in memory only.
